Welcome!<br/>
In this tutorial we'll generate our first few components with Agrippa.

Without further ado, let's begin:

## Creating a fresh project (optional)

First, if you don't already have a project set up, let's spin up one:

We'll use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to scaffold a new environment with React & Typescript. Create a new Vite project & install dependencies from your terminal, like so:

```bash
# npm
npm create vite agrippa-101 -- --template react-ts

cd agrippa-101
npm install
npm run dev

# vite
yarn create vite agrippa-101 --template react-ts

cd agrippa-101
yarn
yarn dev

# pnpm
pnpm create vite agrippa-101 -- --template react-ts

cd agrippa-101
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

If everything succeeds, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and see Vite's default home screen.

<Callout type="warning">
	<p slot="header">Please note</p>
	In the next steps, we're assuming you're working in a React & Typescript environment (like the project we've just created). Everything should still work if you aren't, but you might see slightly different results.
</Callout>

## Configuring Agrippa

Next, let's install Agrippa:

```bash
# npm
npm i -D agrippa@beta
# or
yarn add --dev agrippa@beta
# or
pnpm add -D agrippa@beta
```

Then, let's create a **config file** - this is you can configure Agrippa for your current project.
In your terminal, run:

```bash
# npm
npx agrippa init

# yarn
yarn agrippa init

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa init
```

You should now see a new file in your root directory (where `agrippa init` was called), `agrippa.config.mjs`. Its contents should look like this:

```js
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from "agrippa";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {},
});
```

We'll play around with the config in a few minutes, but for now let's leave it as it is.

## Your first component

We're now ready to start generating components!

Let's start with a basic one. In your terminal, run:

```bash
# npm
npx agrippa gen my-first-component

# yarn
yarn agrippa gen my-first-component

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa gen my-first-component
```

Congratulations, you've just generated your first component with Agrippa üéâüéâ

The `gen` (or the more verbose `generate`) command is Agrippa's main command. It expects a single positional argument - `my-first-component` in our case - which is taken to be the component name (it can be either kebab-case or PascalCase).

The command will create a new directory under your current working directory, `MyFirstComponent`. Take a look inside! there should be two files:

- `MyFirstComponent.tsx` is the main component file - it contains the React component code and a Typescript props interface.
- `index.ts` is a standard index file - currently it only exports everything from the main component code.

Back in your terminal, the output should be similar to this:
![MyFirstComponent output](/tutorial-example-output-first.png)

Note how Agrippa detects you're working in React and Typescript without any configuration on your part! One of Agrippa's design principle is auto-detection of the project's stack - providing you good results with minimal friction.

## Setting a baseDir

You might also have noticed that the component folder was created in the current working directory - typically, your project's root.
Many projects, including our setup here, have a specific directory for components in the app - `src/components` in our case. 

We can tell Agrippa to treat a given path as the base directory for all components through the `baseDir` option.
Augment `agrippa.config.mjs` like so:
 
```js
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig, Styling } from "agrippa";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {
    baseDir: 'src/components', // new line
  },
});
```

Now, let's create another component:
```bash
# npm
npx agrippa gen my-second-component

# yarn
yarn agrippa gen my-second-component

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa gen my-second-component
```

Now the component files should be created under `src/components/MySecondComponent`:
![MySecondComponent output](/tutorial-example-output-second.png)

<Callout type="tip">
You can also tell Agrippa to generate a component *relative* to the base directory (as opposed to a direct children of it).
For more information, check out  [Base Directories](/reference/base-directories).
</Callout>

Next, let's add some styles:

## Adding styles

A component declaration is nice, but most components also need styling!

Let's configure Agrippa to create a CSS file for each component we create:

```js
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig, Styling } from "agrippa";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {
    baseDir: 'src/components',
    styling: Styling.CSS, // new line
  },
});
```

`Styling.CSS` is equivalent to `"css"`, but using the built-in `Styling` enum is clearer and less prone to errors.

Let's test it out:

```bash
# npm
npx agrippa gen my-third-component

# yarn
yarn agrippa gen my-third-component

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa gen my-third-component
```

This time, the output should also contain information about a created CSS file:
![MyThirdComponent output](/tutorial-example-output-third.png)

Note that the created file is by default a CSS module.

Let's try another styling option.
Back in the config, change `Styling.CSS` to `Styling.STYLED_COMPONENTS`, like so:

```js
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig, Styling } from "agrippa";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {
    baseDir: 'src/components',
    styling: Styling.STYLED_COMPONENTS, // modified line
  },
});
```

And create a fourth component:

```bash
# npm
npx agrippa gen my-fourth-component

# yarn
yarn agrippa gen my-fourth-component

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa gen my-fourth-component
```

Now, the output should contain information about `MyFourthComponent.styles.ts` being created:
![MyFourthComponent output](/tutorial-example-output-fourth.png)

	<p slot="header">Tip: Overriding styles</p>
	
All the options that Agrippa accepts in the config file can also be passed directly to the CLI (in kebab case). CLI options have a higher precedence, making them useful for overriding the project configuration for a single component.<br/><br/>
For example, if most of your components have CSS files for styles, but this next component you're creating needs no styles, you can pass `--styling none` to Agrippa and it'll skip creating a CSS file for that one component.
</Callout>

By now, we hope you've already gained an appreciation for how easy it is to generate components from scratch with Agrippa. It has a few additional tools at its disposal to adapt itself to your project and increase your productivity.

We'll conclude this tutorial with one last neat feature:

## Post Commands

An important aspect of Agrippa is its **plugin system**. Let's augment Agrippa's functionality using one:

A _post command_ is a command that runs after Agrippa's main process. It has access to some of the values Agrippa determines, and particularly - _the paths of the created files_. This allows us to run side effects on created files.

One neat such side effect is **opening your IDE at the generated component file**, immediately after generating it. Our example will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but this works with practically [any other common IDE (todo)](/guides/automatically-open-your-ide-to-a-generated-component) too.

Back in `agrippa.config.mjs`, add the following lines:

```js
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig, Styling, PostCommandPlugin } from "agrippa";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {
    baseDir: 'src/components',
    styling: Styling.STYLED_COMPONENTS,
  },
  // new lines
  plugins: [new PostCommandPlugin("code -r <componentPath>")],
});
```
(note the new import of `PostCommandPlugin` from `agrippa`!)

As seen in the example, a post command as declared as a plugin - the `PostCommandPlugin`, which is one of Agrippa's built-in plugins. The argument passed to its constructor is the command to run - in our case the `code` command, which launches VS Code at the path passed to it. `<componentPath>` is the path of the component declaration file.

Let's see it in action!
In your terminal, create yet another component:

```bash
# npm
npx agrippa gen my-fifth-component

# yarn
yarn agrippa gen my-fifth-component

# pnpm
pnpm exec agrippa gen my-fifth-component
```

VSCode should automatically open the component declaration in a new tab (or in a new window
if there aren't any open), and Agrippa should include information about the additional step (the post command) in its output.

Isn't this an elegant productivity trick?
