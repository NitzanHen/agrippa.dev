Agrippa is a CLI that helps frontend developers generate new components without the boilerplate: in a single command, it can create all the folders and files you need in a full component, with starting code tailored to your stack.

It's extremely easy to pick up and use in both new and existing projects, but also has a plugin system that provides customizability when it's necessary.
